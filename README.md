# valve-placement

This repository is for my final project project in Computing with Logic.  It contains copy of the program by Cattafi and Gavanelli used to solve the valve placement problem, with minor additions, as well as an additional test-input file.

The original code, as well the associated research paper, "Optimal placement of valves in a water distribution network with CLP(FD)," can be found here: <https://de.unife.it/en/research/research-1/information-technology/computer-science/artificial-intelligence-group/research-projects/valve-placement/clp>  This page also provides a quick explanation of how to query the program.
